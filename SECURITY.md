## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our open-source software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it through our security advisory system at [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/yourusername/studyforge/security/advisories).

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

### What to Include in Your Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following information:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The impact of the vulnerability
- Any potential mitigations or workarounds
- Your contact information (optional)

### Our Security Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.
2. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the vulnerability and determine its impact and severity.
3. **Fix Development**: If accepted, we will work on a fix and keep you updated on our progress.
4. **Release**: Once a fix is ready, we will release a new version with the security patch.
5. **Disclosure**: We will publicly disclose the vulnerability in the release notes and credit you for your discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

### Safe Harbor

We follow the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure). Any activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorized conduct and we will not initiate legal action against you. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you in connection with activities conducted under this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Always keep your dependencies up to date
- Never expose sensitive environment variables in client-side code
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Regularly review access controls and permissions

### For Developers

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Use security linters and scanners in your CI/CD pipeline
- Conduct regular security audits and code reviews

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be clearly marked in the release notes. We recommend always running the latest patch version of your installed major.minor version.
